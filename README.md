# PowerThings
This repository exists purely to store the random items I have created in Power Apps and Power Automate that may be of use to others.

You are welcome to take anything you like and use it for whatever purpose, however I do ask that you provide attribution where applicable.

If you have any questions, reach out to me on Twitter @LoryanStrant.


The Power "things":
=====================
- Create-To-Do-task-from-Teams-message
This Power Automate flow is as the name implies - you can create a task in To Do from any Teams chat or channel message.
You can see an overview and demo of it here: https://www.loryanstrant.com/2021/02/19/a-simple-workflow-to-create-a-to-do-task-from-microsoft-teams-messages/
