## The "things"

### Create-To-Do-task-from-Teams-message

This Power Automate flow is as the name implies - you can create a task in To Do from any Teams chat or channel message.

You can see an [overview and demo of it here](https://www.loryanstrant.com/2021/02/19/a-simple-workflow-to-create-a-to-do-task-from-microsoft-teams-messages/).


### Home-office-availability-display

This Power App displays your current availability as well as upcoming appointments.

Designed to be used on a tablet mounted outside of your home office door, to show your availability to family members.

You can [see it in action and an overview here](https://www.loryanstrant.com/2021/03/27/build-your-own-home-office-room-display-system/).
